_(This website is currently under construction)_

Hello! I am a **Ph.D. student** advised by Prof. Maria Diuk-Wasser [Eco-epidemiology lab](https://ecoepidemiologylab.e3b.columbia.edu/) in the Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Environmental Biology (E3B) at Columbia University.

My research focuses on how anthropogenic disturbances influence **animal movement** and the cascading effects on **zoonotic pathogen transmission dynamics and hazard formation**. Utilizing this knowledge, I aim to support **structured decision-making** process to identify optimal or cost-effective strategies for hazard control.

Please stay tuned for my research updates! ðŸ’¡ <br><br>

Areas of interest: Disease ecology, Movement ecology, Spatial modeling, Structured decision-making
